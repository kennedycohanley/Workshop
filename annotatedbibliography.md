DATA 150 Spring 2020



**Problem Statement**: 

I am investigating the use of data science to improve the health of women and children, specifically maternal and newborn health. Right now, many women do not have access to safe health care facilities, and are in danger of losing their life or their baby's life, but there is new technology that could help to minimize and eliminate these dangers that women in third world countries face.

1. Tatem, A. J., Campbell, J., Guerra-Arias, M., Bernis, L. D., Moran, A., & Matthews, Z. (2014). Mapping for maternal and newborn health: the distributions of women of childbearing age, pregnancies and births. *International Journal of Health Geographics*, *13*(1), 2. doi: 10.1186/1476-072x-13-2

​	The article questions if there is a way to improve the data and estimations for the distribution of women who are of whild-bearing age. By improving the estimations of these women, we can plan for women to be in more safe conditions regarding their health as they give birth, or the health of their newly-born babies. It discusses the Millennium Development Goals, which are eight goals set by 189 countries, aimed at improving the lives of the poorest around the world. The fourth of these goals is to lower child mortality and the fifth goal targets maternal health. Maternal health is not improving as quickly as leaders had hoped. Even when looking at some of the countries who have progressed well as a whole, there are still subgroups of women whose conditions have not changed, or even worsened, simply because of the inequalities housed in their countries. This article discusses three specific areas in which estimations could be improved to help narrow in on those who really need help: greater estimations of the population, especially women of child-bearing age, better projections about how many pregnancies will last short-term and long-term, and the need to link the information from these pregnancies to the health care facilities nearest to the women who need them. 

​	Specifically in Ethiopia, it is common to have a skilled birth attendant, but there is a need for these SBA to provide access to the poorest women as well. There are huge wealth differences in Ethiopia, and most times the poor women do not have access to an SBA or to a health facility near them. Despite not being able to have access to an SBA, there are midwives and health care workers distributed evenly through poorer areas. However, these health care workers are at about a 1:1,500 ratio with pregnancies. Not only that, but the article writes that Midwifes represent about 60% of maternal and newborn health around the world. United Nations leaders have begun to do Midwife assessments, and are trying to figure out the best way to improve the field and allocate correct resources to the correct areas. 

​	This topic very closely relates to Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, because women should be entitled to a safe and healthy birthing process, both for the mother and child. This is a basic right that every woman should have access to, which closely aligns with Sen’s “friendly” approach to human development. Maternal and newborn health is currently one of the areas of human development that needs the most improvement, and this article does a good job of discussing clear and concise methods to achieve this. Specifically, this article focuses mostly on improving the population estimation of pregnant women and women of child-bearing age. Doing so would help narrow in on specific regions that need more healthcare workers or healthcare facilities. In order to do so, this article speaks directly about using GIS more consistently all around the world, because currently the use of these incredibly helpful technology is not used in every area of the world. This article uses several different geospatial datasets to create visuals that demonstrate how using this technology could enhance our understanding of the women who need more help in every area. Specifically relating to Ethiopia, they collected data on the emergency maternal and newborn health care facilities with GPS locations, and then converted that into GIS shapefile format, which was then translated to a Mollweide projection, which is used to most efficiently calculate distances. This eventually evolved into a visual map that shows the amount of pregnancies in Ethiopia, and how close they are in relation to these emergency care facilities. This article drives home how much it could improve the lives of young mothers, or soon-to-be mothers, and the health of their newborn babies.
