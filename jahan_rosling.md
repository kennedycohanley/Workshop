In Jahan's quick speeches, he discusses a variety of human development aspects. Overall, he emphasized how important data science was to human development, and how while the use of data science was impactful, it would only be helpful if it is publicly available. His definition of human development is very interesting because he looks closer at the difference between economic development and true human development. He makes several interesting points about work. He speaks about how lots of work goes unnoticed, simply because there is no wage attached. Domestic work, for example. In many countries, it is up to the woman of the family to take on the labors of the household. She watches and takes care of the children, cleans, cooks, and does the other jobs around the house, but it is not seen as "work", per se. Another example he gives is the arts. Jahan describes how fruitful the arts can make our life, yet the process of creating isn't always seen as work. Musicians, artists, writers, and more aren't always seen as a part of the labor force. Jahan looks to create a way to actually include all of the work done by those around the world. This time including the jobs with wages, and the labor done without a paycheck. Instead of focusing solely on the economy, Jahan looks to focus on the "richness of life." He uses two different measures to do this. One is the breadth measure, which is broad and encompasses all aspects of human development. The other, the focus measure, focuses mostly on having a long healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. He describes fully how these measures can help us narrow in on using data science to more quickly improve human development. 

Rosling gives data in a different way. He presents very easy to understand visuals, in which he shows fertility and life thoroughly, and income. by using these visuals, he is thoroughly incorporating data science into human development. He has quantified the data of these topics, and is presenting them in a way that is helpful. Rosling talks about the different life expectancies for families in different countries. In 1962 there was a clear connection between having big families and shorter life expectancies in the lesser developed countries, and having smaller families and higher life expectancies in more developed countries. This ties health and wealth closer together. Those that are wealthier, in the more developed countries, are able to maintain a higher life expectancy, while the more poor, had a smaller life expectancy. When discussing the incomes of countries around the world, Rosling makes a very good point in saying that averages are not always the best way to calculate a country's income. While in smaller countries it is more effective, in large countries, there are areas that are developed and wealth, and others that are very poor. Grouping these together defeats the purpose of this data, as those who need help might not get it, since the wealthy could boost the average income of a country. 

Both of these men made some very interesting and insightful comments about the use of data science in human development. The overlying picture was most about how to not get caught up in the numbers, and focus on using the data and technology in a way where those who need help can have quicker access to it.
